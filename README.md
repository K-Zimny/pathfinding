# Pathfinding

## Overview

Pathfinding is a grid-based application that generates a random map and allows the user to define both a start and a destination point. A pathfinding algorithm will then be used to calculate the most efficient route between these two points. This project aims to visualize and explore different pathfinding techniques in a dynamic environment.

## Features

- **Random Map Generation**: The map is generated using a grid system where each cell represents a unique terrain type.
- **User-defined Start and Destination Points**: Users can interact with the grid to set the starting and destination locations.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: The app utilizes pathfinding algorithms such as A\*, Dijkstra, or others to find the most efficient path between the start and destination points.
- **Visualization**: The algorithm's process of finding a path is visually represented on the grid.
